## Setupping this project to run it on your own PC

Run "npm install" in the IDE terminal opened in the project's directory to get dependencies

### Database Setup

1. Production database: web-pizzeriadb

- Run the web-pizzeriadb.sql file in the dbsetup directory
- Run this code snippet with your password for your future admin account to hash your admin account's password:

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const password = 'yourAdminPassword'; // replace with the real password
const Rounds = 16;

bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, function (err, hash) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Hashed password:', hash);
});
```

- Then put your information and hashed password in this query and run it:

```sql
INSERT INTO `user_accounts` (`user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `phone_number`, `address`, `profile_picture`, `role`) VALUES
(1, 'yourname', 'email', 'hashedpassword', 'phone number', 'address', 'picture url','admin')
```

2. Test database: test-pizzeriadb

- Run the test-pizzeriadb.sql file in the dbsetup directory
- Do the same above or just put the same sql query you did already

### JWT_SECRET generation

This will be needed in .env setup

- Run the code below in node running the file you put this in:
  - node example.js

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');

const jwtSecret = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');

console.log('JWT Secret:', jwtSecret);
```

### .env setup

- Create .env file in the project's directory and in the client directory
- Fill all the placeholders here (project's directory .env):

```env
DB_HOST=yourdbhost
DB_USER=yourdbuser
DB_PASSWORD=yourdbuserpassword
DB_NAME=web-pizzeriadb
DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=Yourgeneratedstring
TEST_DB_USER=yourtestuser
TEST_DB_PASSWORD=yourtestuserpassword
TEST_DB_NAME=test-pizzeriadb
```

### Running the Application
